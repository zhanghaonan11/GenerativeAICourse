      "Response: Investing your money is an important decision, and the best choice depends on your individual financial goals, risk tolerance, time horizon, and current financial situation. Here are some steps and options to consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Define Your Goals**: \n",
      "   - Determine what you want to achieve with this investment. Are you saving for retirement, a down payment on a home, an emergency fund, or something else?\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Assess Your Risk Tolerance**: \n",
      "   - Understand how much risk you are willing to take. Generally, stocks are riskier but have the potential for higher returns, whereas bonds are more stable but offer lower returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Establish a Time Horizon**: \n",
      "   - Decide how long you plan to invest the money. Short-term goals (less than 3 years) usually require safer investments, while long-term goals (5+ years) can afford more volatility.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Consider Diversification**:\n",
      "   - Diversifying your investments can help manage risk. Instead of putting all your money in one type of asset, spread it across different asset classes (e.g., stocks, bonds, real estate).\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Investment Options**:\n",
      "   - **Stock Market**: Consider investing in individual stocks or exchange-traded funds (ETFs) which track indices like the S&P 500. ETFs offer diversification and usually have lower fees.\n",
      "   - **Bonds**: Look into government or corporate bonds, especially if you prefer stability and fixed returns.\n",
      "   - **Mutual Funds**: These are actively managed and offer diversified investments within a single fund.\n",
      "   - **Real Estate**: If youâ€™re interested in property, real estate investment trusts (REITs) allow you to invest in real estate without the need to buy property.\n",
      "   - **Robo-Advisors**: Services that use algorithms to create and manage a diversified portfolio for you based on your risk tolerance.\n",
      "   - **Savings Accounts or CDs**: For short-term goals, a high-yield savings account or certificates of deposit (CDs) may be appropriate.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Emergency Fund**: \n",
      "   - Ensure you have an emergency fund of 3-6 months of living expenses before investing in riskier assets.\n",
      "\n",
      "7. **Tax-Advantaged Accounts**:\n",
      "   - Consider using tax-advantaged accounts like IRAs or 401(k)s if you are saving for retirement. These accounts offer tax benefits that can enhance your returns.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Stay Informed and Review Regularly**: \n",
      "   - Keep up with market trends and periodically review your investment strategy to ensure it still aligns with your goals and risk tolerance.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Consult a Financial Advisor**:\n",
      "   - If you're unsure, consult with a certified financial planner or advisor who can provide personalized guidance based on your specific situation.\n",
      "\n",
      "Each of these options has its own risk and reward profile, and it's crucial to do some research or seek professional advice tailored to your individual circumstances.\n",

      "Response: 1. **High-yield Savings Account**: This offers a secure place to store your funds while earning modest interest. Suitable for those seeking to maintain liquidity. Timeline: Ideal for short-term savings, typically 1-3 years. Risk Level: Low.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Certificates of Deposit (CDs)**: CDs provide fixed interest rates over predetermined periods, such as 1-5 years. They are safe, with better returns than regular savings accounts but require you to lock in your money. Timeline: Medium-term commitment, often 1-5 years. Risk Level: Low.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **U.S. Treasury Bonds or Bills**: Backed by the government, these are among the safest investments. They provide regular interest payments, with different durations available. Timeline: Variable, typically from a few months to 30 years for bonds. Risk Level: Low.\n",

    "### Why Self-Consistency Works\n",
    "\n",
    "Self-consistency is effective because:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Random errors cancel out**: If the model makes occasional calculation mistakes, they won't be consistent across attempts\n",
    "2. **Systematic correct reasoning emerges**: The correct approach will tend to produce the same answer repeatedly\n",
    "3. **Higher confidence**: When multiple independent attempts agree, we can be more confident in the result\n",
    "4. **Robust to model uncertainty**: Even if the model is unsure, the most frequent answer is likely correct\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to Use Self-Consistency\n",
    "\n",
    "- **High-stakes decisions** where accuracy is critical\n",
    "- **Problems with objective correct answers** (math, logic, factual questions)\n",
    "- **When a single attempt might contain errors**\n",

    "\n",
    "## Why Advanced Prompting Matters\n",
    "\n",
    "Basic prompting is like asking someone \"Can you help me with my business?\" Advanced prompting is like asking \"Can you analyze our Q3 sales data, compare it to industry benchmarks, identify the top 3 growth opportunities, and create an action plan with timelines?\" The more complex your problem, the more these techniques matter.\n",

    "## 1. Chain of Thought (CoT) Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "Chain of Thought is a technique that encourages the model to break down complex reasoning into a sequence of intermediate steps. This approach mimics how humans tackle difficult problems by showing the work rather than jumping straight to the answer.\n",

    "\n",
    "When using Chain of Thought, we explicitly:\n",

    "3. Show the intermediate reasoning\n",
    "4. Arrive at a final answer\n",

    "## Conclusion: Prompt Security Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "As we've seen throughout this section, securing LLM applications requires a multi-layered approach. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Never trust raw user input** - Always treat user input as potentially malicious\n",
    "2. **Use structural defenses** like XML tagging to separate instructions from content\n",
    "3. **Implement the Sandwich Defense** for critical applications\n",
    "4. **Add input sanitization** to catch obvious attack patterns\n",
    "5. **Include explicit refusal instructions** in your system prompts\n",
    "6. **Control information access** based on request sensitivity\n",
    "7. **Layer multiple techniques** for maximum security\n",
    "8. **Test your defenses** with simulated attacks\n",
    "\n",
    "While no defense is perfect, properly implemented prompt security techniques significantly reduce the risk of your AI system being manipulated or compromised.\n",

    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive notebook has demonstrated prompt engineering techniques from basic to advanced, plus essential security considerations. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Techniques:**\n",
    "1. Being specific reduces token usage and improves response quality\n",
    "2. Role assignment and constraints focus the model's behavior\n",
    "3. Self-check mechanisms help models validate their work\n",
    "4. Few-shot prompting provides examples to guide output format\n",
    "5. Self-consistency improves accuracy by considering multiple attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Techniques:**\n",
    "1. Chain of Thought breaks complex problems into manageable steps\n",
    "2. Tree of Thoughts explores multiple solution paths\n",
    "3. Algorithm of Thoughts applies systematic procedures\n",
    "4. Generated Knowledge separates fact generation from reasoning\n",
    "5. Rephrase and Respond ensures clarity before answering\n",
    "6. Multi-Strategy approaches combine techniques for comprehensive problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Techniques:**\n",
    "1. Understand prompt injection vulnerabilities\n",
    "2. Use defensive techniques like Sandwich Defense and XML tagging\n",
    "3. Implement input sanitization for additional protection\n",
    "4. Guard against jailbreak attempts\n",
    "5. Combine multiple defenses for production applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that different models may respond differently to these techniques. It's important to test and adapt your approach based on the specific model you're using and your particular use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with combinations of these techniques\n",
    "- Try different parameters (temperature, top_p) to see their effects\n",
    "- Test these techniques across different models\n",
    "- Create a benchmark to compare cost vs. quality tradeoffs\n",
    "- Develop a prompt template system for your specific applications\n",
    "- Stay updated on new prompting techniques and security considerations"
