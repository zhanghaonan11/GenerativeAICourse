    "# Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This comprehensive notebook has demonstrated prompt engineering techniques from basic to advanced, plus essential security considerations. Key takeaways:\n",
    "\n",
    "**Basic Techniques:**\n",
    "1. Being specific reduces token usage and improves response quality\n",
    "2. Role assignment and constraints focus the model's behavior\n",
    "3. Self-check mechanisms help models validate their work\n",
    "4. Few-shot prompting provides examples to guide output format\n",
    "5. Self-consistency improves accuracy by considering multiple attempts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advanced Techniques:**\n",
    "1. Chain of Thought breaks complex problems into manageable steps\n",
    "2. Tree of Thoughts explores multiple solution paths\n",
    "3. Algorithm of Thoughts applies systematic procedures\n",
    "4. Generated Knowledge separates fact generation from reasoning\n",
    "5. Rephrase and Respond ensures clarity before answering\n",
    "6. Multi-Strategy approaches combine techniques for comprehensive problem-solving\n",
    "\n",
    "**Security Techniques:**\n",
    "1. Understand prompt injection vulnerabilities\n",
    "2. Use defensive techniques like Sandwich Defense and XML tagging\n",
    "3. Implement input sanitization for additional protection\n",
    "4. Guard against jailbreak attempts\n",
    "5. Combine multiple defenses for production applications\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember that different models may respond differently to these techniques. It's important to test and adapt your approach based on the specific model you're using and your particular use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Next Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "- Experiment with combinations of these techniques\n",
    "- Try different parameters (temperature, top_p) to see their effects\n",
    "- Test these techniques across different models\n",
    "- Create a benchmark to compare cost vs. quality tradeoffs\n",
    "- Develop a prompt template system for your specific applications\n",
    "- Stay updated on new prompting techniques and security considerations"
